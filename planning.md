# Key notes
I am using VSCode and have created a venv in this project directory under .venv.
I am using uv to manage my package dependencies. Please use uv to add dependencies when necessary (uv add).
My API keys are stored via environment variables GEMINI_API_KEY and ANTHROPIC_API_KEY.
No unit tests are required for this project.
The deployed streamlit app will be stored in src/app.py. Do not edit this file. Please only edit src/app_test.py. If the desired output is achieved, I will then transfer the code into app.py.

# Overarching Plan
This project is a streamlit web app for a chat-based management simulation for training physicians and medical students on emergency medicine cases. 

## Desired Output
The final output should be a streamlit webapp with a LLM chat interface. We will use the litellm package so that different models can be changed.

There will be an initial dropdown list that enables choosing the model. Focus on Gemini models with gemini 2.0 flash as the default.
