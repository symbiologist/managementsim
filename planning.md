# Overarching Plan
This project is a streamlit web app for a chat-based management simulation for training physicians and medical students on emergency medicine cases.

## Desired Output
The final output should be a streamlit webapp with a LLM chat interface. We will use the litellm package so that different models can be changed.

There will be an initial dropdown list that enables choosing the model. Focus on Gemini models with gemini 2.0 flash as the default.
