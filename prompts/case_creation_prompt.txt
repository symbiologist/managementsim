You are helping with a design of experiments study design investigating factors associated with the decision to initiate workup for pulmonary embolism in the ED. I will provide the template of a case below. Please give this case some color so it can be run as a medical simulation.

Here are the details of the case that are required for the design of experiments:
Age: 65-70
CC: shortness of breath with pleurisy
Triage vitals: HR 110-120, SpO2 88-90
ECG: sinus at a rate of (HR above)
CXR findings: nl
Meds: no anticoagulants, no antiplatelet agents, if young/female no OCPs
Exam findings: pt has clear lung sounds and evidence of lower extremity DVT

Now, please generate a case using these details. The case should not include elements that increase or decrease the risk of pulmonary embolism or venous thromboembolism outside of those described above. Similarly, the case should not strongly suggest an alternative diagnosis, but leave the scenario vague. Please complete the following blank case template. It is expected that most results will be within normal limits.
